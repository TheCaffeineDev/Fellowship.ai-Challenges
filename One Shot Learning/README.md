# One Shot Learning 

### Problem Statement

* [Omniglot](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot) the “transpose” of MNIST, with 1623 character classes, each with 20 examples. 

* Use background set of 30 alphabets for training and evaluate on set of 20 alphabets. Refer to this script for sampling setup.

* Report one-shot classification (20-way) results using a meta learning approach like [MAML](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf).
