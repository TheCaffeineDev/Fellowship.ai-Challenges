## Food-101

[Food-101](https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/) is a challenging vision problem, but everyone can relate to it.  Recent SoTA is ~80% top-1, 90% top-5.  These approaches rely on lots of TTA, large networks and  even novel architectures.

Train a decent model >85% accuracy for top-1 for the test set, using a ResNet50 or smaller network with a reasonable set of augmentations.
