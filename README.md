## Food-101

*** [Solution](https://github.com/TheCaffeineDev/Fellowship.ai-Challenges/blob/master/Food-101/Food-101.ipynb) ***

[Food-101](https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/) is a challenging vision problem, but everyone can relate to it.  Recent SoTA is ~80% top-1, 90% top-5.  These approaches rely on lots of TTA, large networks and  even novel architectures.

Train a decent model >85% accuracy for top-1 for the test set, using a ResNet50 or smaller network with a reasonable set of augmentations.

* [Omniglot](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot) the “transpose” of MNIST, with 1623 character classes, each with 20 examples. 

* Use background set of 30 alphabets for training and evaluate on set of 20 alphabets. Refer to this script for sampling setup.
